# Mattia Müggler

Hi 👋, my name is Mattia Müggler. I'm 20 years old and I work as a software engineer 👨‍💻 in Switzerland 🇨🇭. In my spare time I like to do some private coding projects. I mostly prefer developing backends with Go, but I am also able to develop backends with Kotlin and frontends with Angular and Nuxt.
